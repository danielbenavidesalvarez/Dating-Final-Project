The program will enable users to create profiles, browse, and connect with compatible individuals based on several criteria, including physical characteristics, location, age, interests, values, and religion. Users will be able to:


* Create and customize their profiles with essential details.
* Set preferences for age range, location, and interests to enhance compatibility.
* Continue practicing with git in preparation for the group project.
* Receive a list of potential matches based on compatibility scores.
* Interact with matches through messaging and can block or report any user for safety concerns.

# Use Cases

Our program will aim to work with the following use cases, each corresponding to a different user story, and each proposed by one member of the group.


Use case 1:

Maya just broke up with her boyfriend. She wants to meet a new partner but she’d prefer someone older and more mature then her old boyfriend. Maya decides to use our app to prompt for a man that’s 25+ and lives in the same city. After matching, they text, and meet using the app interface.

Use case 2:

David is a registered user, and he wants to set his preferred age range and location radius for matches to focus on people who fit within his desired age group and are nearby. That would be the most convenient for him since he would not be willing to travel long distances due to his on-site job.

Use case 3:

John just left his hometown of Valencia, Spain to attend the University of Toronto in Toronto, Canada. He is new to the city and is looking to date people from his university who speak his first language, Spanish. He enjoys playing sports, drawing, and board games and would appreciate for his partner to share his interests. He prefers women and prefers people between ages 19 and 25. Our app helps John connect with potential partners.

Use case 4:

Julia is in her 2nd year of university and, after living on-campus her first year, she is now renting a studio apartment because she likes her personal space. However, after the first 2 months, she feels like she doesn’t get to meet people outside of classes anymore and would like to make friends to hang out with after classes. She enjoys playing frisbee, spikeball, and wine nights. Our app will help her connect with other people looking to make friends.
